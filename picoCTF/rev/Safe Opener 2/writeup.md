## Description
What can you do with this file?

I forgot the key to my safe but this [file](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/289/SafeOpener.class) is supposed to help me with retrieving the lost key. Can you help me unlock my safe?
### Hints
Download and try to decompile the file.

## Solution
doing `strings SafeOpener.class` gives u the flag, no reversing needed...
